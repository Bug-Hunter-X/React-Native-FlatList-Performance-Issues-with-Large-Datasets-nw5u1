This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using React Native's FlatList component with extensive datasets.  The original code (`FlatListBug.js`) showcases inefficient rendering practices. The solution (`FlatListBugSolution.js`) provides an optimized approach to improve performance significantly by implementing a proper `keyExtractor` and reducing unnecessary re-renders within `renderItem`. The optimized solution utilizes virtualization and memoization techniques for enhanced efficiency.  This example helps developers understand and avoid common pitfalls when dealing with large lists in React Native applications.
